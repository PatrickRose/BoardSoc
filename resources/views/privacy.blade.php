					We legally have to have a privacy policy.
					We're really sorry about this
				</p>

				<p>
					Members are entitled to an account on this website to facilitate loaning of games and notifications of upcoming events. This will usually be done by a committee member at the beginning of the year in bulk or when someone signs up at an event.
				</p>

				<p>
					When your account is created you will not receive notifications by default - you'll have to explicitly opt in to this.
				</p>

				<p>
					We only store your name and your email to provide this. If you don't want us to even have this, then log in and delete your account - it'll be deleted straight away. If you have any issues, then contact <a href="mailto:boardsoc@sheffield.ac.uk">boardsoc@sheffield.ac.uk</a>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Not having an account means you can't loan a game from the society - sorry, but it's the easiest way of us tracking who's got which game.
				</p>

				<p>
					If you have online membership via the Student's Union site, then <a href="mailto:boardsoc@sheffield.ac.uk">get in touch with us</a> about removing it from there.
